                "The modal approach enables the dynamic behavior of a structure to be predicted based on knowledge of its natural modes of vibration, which are intrinsic to the system. From a practical point of view, this information can be used to determine the frequencies at which the structure is most likely to vibrate. For industry, this information is invaluable, as vibrations can cause discomfort, noise, premature wear and tear, or even damage to a system. This is where **Experimental Modal Analysis** (EMA) comes in. Experimental identification of vibration modes can also be used to calibrate a finite element model or certify a product (e.g. ground vibration testing or regulations related to the modal behavior of the structure).\n",
